function [switchLOS, output] = LOSOutputGenerator(timeDivision,...
    CADoutput, Rx, Tx, output, velocityTx, velocityRx, switchCP,...
    PolarizationTx, switchMaterial, MobilitySwitch, numberOfNodes, frequency)
% This part of code compute LOS between two nodes
%
%Inputs:
% timeDivision - it is the time instance number
%CADoutput - CAD output
%Tx and Rx locations if using two nodes
%velocityTx, velocityRx are velocities of tx and rx respectively
%output - multipath parameters
%switchCP - a boolean to describe whether cross polarization is selected
%or not. 1 means there is cross polarization and 0 means there is no cross
%polarization
%PolarizationTx - gives polarization information of Tx location
%f1 - figure that displays multipath
%f2 - figure that displays channel model
%switchMaterial - boolean which gives information whether material
%properties are presnet in CAD output
%output - multipath parameters
%MobilitySwitch is boolean to either have mobility or not
%numberOfNodes - total number of nodes
% frequency: the carrier frequency at which the system operates
%
%Outputs:
%f1 - figure that displays multipath
%f2 - figure that displays channel model
%switchLOS - a boolean which gives information whether LOS exist or not.
%1 stands for existant while 0 is for non existant case
%output - multipath parameters
